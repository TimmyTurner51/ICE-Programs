# ICE-Programs

This is for the TI 84 Plus CE
1.) Download these files, and the ICE Compiler (By P_T). Then, use TI Connect CE to put the programs on your CE
2.) Compile the programs with the ICE Compiler
3.) Launch the compiled program. 

Notes:
- When converting your icon, the icon creator cannot (yet) re-open the icon you just converted.
- In the program the Icon Creator makes (with your icon data in it), notice after ':DCS', there is '.[data].', please
replace the '.' with a ':', and add that line to the next line, as the way DCS icons are formatted.

Thank you for trying out my program. I will be constantly updating it here shortly...
